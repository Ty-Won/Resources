## Programming Languages
If you've never programmed before,let's start off by picking up a language to write your code in! Keep in mind that depending on the task you are doing, some languages might be easier to use than others! Every Language has a purpose

* Java, C, Python, Javascript ,C++, C# and many more!

# :heavy_plus_sign: :heavy_minus_sign: Math Resources :heavy_division_sign: :heavy_multiplication_x:

Bit rusty at algebra? Don't remember the quotient rule, poisson distribution or first order differential equations? We got you :sunglasses:

* [Paul's Math Notes](http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/) - This is a resource that covers Calculus and Ordinary differential Equations. You can download Pdfs of all the notes so this is a great way to find great explanation to math concepts will see in U0-U2

* [betterExplained](https://betterexplained.com/cheatsheet/) - This site extends beyond calculus and has some notes on linear, euler, fourier transforms, stats and many other mathematical topics.


## Programming Tutorials
* [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/) - Great hands on lessons to teach basic syntax for programming languages, has an in browser editor to run code
* [Tutorial Point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/index.htm) - Doesn't have hands on code editor but this is a great site to get a more extensive list of syntax and to use for reference
* [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) - Great resource for learning web technologies and has you learning and later on building projects! (Has an in browser text editor)
* [SoloLearn](https://www.sololearn.com/) - This web site has small interactive questions to test you after the lesson which is nice. The Nice thing about this organization is that it has offline apps that you can download to learn your lessons on the go!

## Software Concepts
* [Design Patterns](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns) - A good resource to explain software design patterns and how they are used to improve code reuse, understandability and efficiency.


## Command Line
* http://learnshell.org/ - This is a nice Interactive guide that has an online shell for you to test commands out!

## Git
* [Official Git Documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs) - Full extensive list of all the Git Commands

* [Git Cheat Sheet](https://services.github.com/on-demand/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf) -  Quick pdf for list of most common git commands

* [What is version control?](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control) - Atlassian's guide provides a nice breakdown of VCS and how to use Git for projects


## Markdown

* [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf) - List of common markdown syntax

## API List
* https://apilist.fun/
* https://any-api.com/


## Miscellaneous Skills
* https://betterexplained.com/cheatsheet/ (A handful of useful tutorials! In particular Math is nice with this one
if you need to refer to a math source or if you don't come from a STEM background)



## Software Interviews

* Cracking the Coding (Or PM) Interview Book by Gayle Laakmann McDowell

* [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) - Great for interview practice questions to help you tackle those algorithms. Has Contests to test your problem solving skills!

* [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) - An alternative site for interview practice questions. Has more wordy situation problems in comparison to leetcode. Has competitions to test your problem solving skills!

* [Geeks for geek](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fundamentals-of-algorithms/#AnalysisofAlgorithms) - Great for algorithm review (Additionally it has CS theory concepts and language tutorials)
