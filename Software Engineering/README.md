# :computer: Software Engineering Resources 

## Programming Tutorials
If you've never programmed before,let's start off by picking up a language to write your code in! Keep in mind that depending on the task you are doing, some languages might be easier to use than others! Every Language has a purpose

* Java, C, Python, Javascript ,C++, C# and many more!

* [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/) - Great hands on lessons to teach basic syntax for programming languages, has an in browser editor to run code
* [Tutorial Point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/index.htm) - Doesn't have hands on code editor but this is a great site to get a more extensive list of syntax and to use for reference
* [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) - Great resource for learning web technologies and has you learning and later on building projects! (Has an in browser text editor)
* [SoloLearn](https://www.sololearn.com/) - This web site has small interactive questions to test you after the lesson which is nice. The Nice thing about this organization is that it has offline apps that you can download to learn your lessons on the go!

# :heavy_plus_sign: :heavy_minus_sign: Math Resources :heavy_division_sign: :heavy_multiplication_x:

Bit rusty at algebra? Don't remember the quotient rule, poisson distribution or first order differential equations? We got you :sunglasses:

* [Paul's Math Notes](http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/) - This is a resource that covers Calculus and Ordinary differential Equations. You can download Pdfs of all the notes so this is a great way to find great explanation to math concepts will see in U0-U2

* [betterExplained](https://betterexplained.com/cheatsheet/) - This site extends beyond calculus and has some notes on linear, euler, fourier transforms, stats and many other mathematical topics.


## :bulb: Software Concepts 


* [Design Patterns](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns) - A good resource to explain software design patterns and how they are used to improve code reuse, understandability and efficiency.

* [Continuous Integration](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-continuous-integration-delivery-and-deployment) - Learn how to facilitate the development process by setting up a system to automatically build your code and test it for you!


## :computer: Command Line >_
Are you hacker? Do you write in VIM only and program in assembly?:sunglasses: Just kidding. It can seem daunting at first when you would open the command prompt by accident and were scared to type something in and break something (Don't do **rm -rf /** ). Learning how to use the command line is essential for programmers! It will be a very useful tool for you to learn and it will come in handy for projects and for internships :fire:

* http://learnshell.org/ - This is a nice Interactive guide that has an online shell for you to test commands out! It contains a 101 introduction to making use of BASH shell programming to allow you to understand how to write all some cool scripts :sunglasses:

* [Learn enough command line to be dangerous](https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial/basics) - Learn the fundamental command line commands (Unix machines) to be able to navigate through your computer and perform all the tasks you need with a few keywords :pray:

* [Command Prompt guide](https://www.hacking-tutorial.com/tips-and-trick/16-steps-tutorial-basic-command-prompt/#sthash.Nn4jevZE.dpbs) - **Window users!** This guide will give you a brief rundown of commands to use and why they are useful for your machines since they have some different commands in comparison to Unix Shells.

## Version Control :octocat:
No more emailing code. No more sending zip files. NO MORE SAVING TO USBs and passing it around! Version control systems are super useful to keep track of code changes and to share your projects across machines! There are many different Version control systems but one of the most popular is Git!
* [Official Git Documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs) - Full extensive list of all the Git Commands

* [Git Cheat Sheet](https://services.github.com/on-demand/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf) -  Quick pdf for list of most common git commands

* [What is version control?](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control) - Atlassian's guide provides a nice breakdown of VCS and how to use Git for projects

* [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf) - List of common markdown syntax to accomodate those READMEs in your repositories :)


## :key: API List :checkered_flag: :heavy_check_mark:
Get those projects out! There are a lot of online tools that you can use to ease the implementation of a project. There are all sorts of APIs that will make your life easier during your development process.:sunglasses:  Feel free to search them up and see what they can do. Additionally, many companies have APIs! This can be a nice way to get familiar with their technologies! :star:

Don't know what's an API? Don't worry, this quick read will bring you up to speed!
* [What is an API?](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/what-is-an-api-in-english-please-b880a3214a82?gi=c685ef260400)

These 2 sites allow you to search for APIs based on category! They're perfect for projects and hackathons!

## Software Interviews
Landing interviews is hard! Passing them is Hard too! Check these resources out to help you with your tech interview prep! Practice lots of problems:) Think out loud and don't panic! You got this :sunglasses:

* Cracking the Coding (Or PM) Interview Book by Gayle Laakmann McDowell

* [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) - Great for interview practice questions to help you tackle those algorithms. Has Contests to test your problem solving skills!

* [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) - An alternative site for interview practice questions. Has more wordy situation problems in comparison to leetcode. Has competitions to test your problem solving skills!

* [Geeks for geek](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fundamentals-of-algorithms/#AnalysisofAlgorithms) - Great for algorithm review (Additionally it has CS theory concepts and language tutorials)
