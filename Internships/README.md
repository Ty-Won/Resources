# Internship Guide

Hi there! Welcome to this guide I've prepared on internships!

## Why should you do an internship?

* Helps you make your career choices, helps you understand whether you want to pursue a career in software or hardware or maybe neither? 

* Allows you to develop new skills and learn a lot of new tools and technologies outsdie classroom.

* Provides you with valuable qualifications while looking for actual employment.

* Expands your network.

## Finding an internship

### 1. Build your resume!

* Take project classes (ie. ECSE 211, ECSE 223), get involved around campus, participate in hackathons (_cough cough_ CodeJam) or do personal projects in your free time!

* Learn how to structure an effective resume, take CCOM206 _lol_ or participate in workshops organised by [TechWeek](https://mcgilleus.ca/techweek), [ECC](https://www.mcgill.ca/careers4engineers/), [CaPS](https://www.mcgill.ca/caps/) or even RezLife.

### 2. Find internship opportunities!

* Use [myFuture](https://caps.myfuture.mcgill.ca/students/?signin_tab=0) to see available opportunities in Montreal and even other cities and countries!

* Network! Family, friends, friends of family, family of friends, friends of friends are all excellent resources when it comes to search for internship opportunities. They may be able to hook you up with someone they know for a job you're interested in!

* Go to [TechFair](https://www.mcgill.ca/careers4engineers/techfair) and other networking events around campus such as speed networkings organised by POWE, SEAM, ECSESS and CSUS to build up your network!

### 3. Interview Prep

* Prepare for the interview questions specifically for the position you've applied for. For example, questions they will ask for a testing role will be different from questions they would ask for a development position. You could use [GlassDoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/index.htm) to see previous questions asked by companies in their recruitment process. 

* [GlassDoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/index.htm) is also useful to see company reviews to see if it's a nice place to work at and get insight into salaries and company culture. However, bear in mind that, people tend to complain more when negative experiences than they show appreciation when they have positive experiences, so the reviews can be deceitful. 

* [Leet Coding](https://leetcode.com/) and practicing questions on Cracking the Coding Interview book is a great idea to practice for development / testing interviews! 

* You could arrange yourself a mock interview in ECC before your interviews in MESC (in FDA)!

#### Good luck! I hope this guide helps you land an internship! :heart:
