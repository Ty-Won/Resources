# Electrical Engineering Resources 

If you're a new EE student or simply just interested in electrical engineering projects and know hows! We've assembled some resources for you so that you can use them in your labs, your own personal projects, design teams or work in the ECSESS Factory!


# :heavy_plus_sign: :heavy_minus_sign: Math Resources :heavy_division_sign: :heavy_multiplication_x:

Bit rusty at algebra? Don't remember the quotient rule, poisson distribution or first order differential equations? We got you :sunglasses:

* [Paul's Math Notes](http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/) - This is a resource that covers Calculus and Ordinary differential Equations. You can download Pdfs of all the notes so this is a great way to find great explanation to math concepts will see in U0-U2

* [betterExplained](https://betterexplained.com/cheatsheet/) - This site extends beyond calculus and has some notes on linear, euler, fourier transforms, stats and many other mathematical topics.

## Circuit Resources
Need to touch up on some V=IR, P=VI, Q=CV? Here are some great resources that you can use for circuit classes and for those labs that involve using electronic components. Hopefully these resources arent too shocking for ya :electric_plug: :zap:

* [Electronics Tutorial](https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/) - This site has some pretty nice explanation for circuit concepts involving your standard circuit components such as resistors, capacitors, transistors, Op Amps, AC Vs DC.

* [Circuit Online Simulator](https://www.falstad.com/circuit/) - Falstad's circuit simulator web app is a nice way to test circuits without having to build them. It creates custom virtual electronic components that you man map together to make your circuit and you can gather measurements from the components as well!

* [Circuits Component tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGI9d0CjI8s&index=1&list=PLYS_1w0FFIANdG78JyJu3tsumsXVIcXUB) - This videos resource covers electrical theory and tutorials on electronic components

## Signal Processing


* [Signal processing 101](https://signalprocessingsociety.org/our-story/signal-processing-101) - This is a great source for learning about signals basics and may help you with ecse 206


# Organizations
Need to get some hands on experience outside the classroom? :facepunch: Here are some organizations around campus that'll help you get stuff done!

* [The Factory](https://www.facebook.com/ecsessfactory/) - The Factory is a student run project lab located in Trottier 0080! We offer free rentals and equipment for student side projects!

* [The Cube](https://www.facebook.com/thecube3dprinting/) - The Cube is a lab in the MacDonald Engineering building in Room 264! They provide access to 3D Printers that you can use to create parts for your DIY projects

* [Roboelectronics](https://ere.mcgilleus.ca/) - A great club to learn hands-on skills in electronics and robotics to McGill students with all levels of experience.


## Project Ideas
* [Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/technology/) - This is a great DIY website that provides tutorials on how to make some neat electronic gadgets!

* [Adafruit](https://learn.adafruit.com/) - This website sells a bunch of great electronics but also gives great tutorials on what you can do with those electronics
