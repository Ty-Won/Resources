# Electrical Engineering Resources 

If you're a new EE student or simply just interested in electrical engineering projects and know hows! We've assembled some resources for you so that you can use them in your labs, your own personal projects, design teams or work in the ECSESS Factory!


# :heavy_plus_sign: :heavy_minus_sign: Math Resources :heavy_division_sign: :heavy_multiplication_x:

Bit rusty at algebra? Don't remember the quotient rule, poisson distribution or first order differential equations? We got you :sunglasses:

* [Paul's Math Notes](http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/) - This is a resource that covers Calculus and Ordinary differential Equations. You can download Pdfs of all the notes so this is a great way to find great explanation to math concepts will see in U0-U2.

* [betterExplained](https://betterexplained.com/cheatsheet/) - This site extends beyond calculus and has some notes on linear, euler, fourier transforms, stats and many other mathematical topics.

## Circuit Resources
Need to touch up on some V=IR, P=VI, Q=CV? Here are some great resources that you can use for circuit classes and for those labs that involve using electronic components. Hopefully these resources arent too shocking for ya :electric_plug: :zap:

* [Electronics Tutorial](https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/) - This site has some pretty nice explanation to read for circuit concepts involving your standard circuit components such as resistors, capacitors, transistors, Op Amps, AC Vs DC.

* [Khan Academy Electrical Engineering](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/electrical-engineering#ee-signals) - Not a reader? That's okay! Thanks to great open education sites like Khan Academy, you can get video lectures breaking down electrical engineering 101!

* [Circuit Online Simulator](https://www.falstad.com/circuit/) - Falstad's circuit simulator web app is a nice way to test circuits without having to build them. It creates custom virtual electronic components that you man map together to make your circuit and you can gather measurements from the components as well!

* [Circuits Component tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGI9d0CjI8s&index=1&list=PLYS_1w0FFIANdG78JyJu3tsumsXVIcXUB) - This video resource covers electrical theory and tutorials on electronic components

## Signal Processing
Forward, back propagating waves? Fourier transforms? Frequency Response? Square wave? Sin wave? Sawtooth? Signals have a lot of in dept material providing insight on how modern technology handles data in many forms. Whether you are dealing with 


* [Signal processing 101](https://signalprocessingsociety.org/our-story/signal-processing-101) - This is a great source for learning about signals basics and may help you with ecse 206

* [Signal Simulations](https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulations/category/physics/sound-and-waves) - Credits to the University of Colorado for making these simulations on sounds and waves! See how a fourier transform works! (Note you may need java to run some of these simulations)


## :bulb: Physics :rocket:
Is it a :wave: wave? Is it a particle :collision:? Does it behave like both? Throughout your electrical degree, you'll learn about electromagnetic waves and fields, mechanics and other real world physical principles. i.e) Maxwell Equations, Angular velocities, torque, signals! :collision:
All of it can be a bit intimidating and confusing but don't worry! We got some places you can study off to ace those tough equations and accelerate past those classes F=MA style ;) 

* [Michel Van Biezen](https://www.youtube.com/user/ilectureonline/playlists?view=50&shelf_id=10&sort=dd) - He covers physics problems, circuit problems, calculus problems. This youtube makes clear explanations about physics and is a definite must watch to understand how to apply what you've been learning in class.

* [Phet Simulations](https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulations/category/physics/electricity-magnets-and-circuits) - Credits to the University of Colorado for making these online physics simulations. These simulations are a great way to visualize and fiddle around with concepts to gain a better understanding of how things work. Some of the experiments involve motions, electricity and waves! (Note you may need java to run some of these simulations)


# Organizations
Need to get some hands on experience outside the classroom? :facepunch: Here are some organizations around campus that'll help you get stuff done!

* [The Factory](https://www.facebook.com/ecsessfactory/) - The Factory is a student run project lab located in Trottier 0080! We offer free rentals and equipment for student side projects!

* [The Cube](https://www.facebook.com/thecube3dprinting/) - The Cube is a lab in the MacDonald Engineering building in Room 264! They provide access to 3D Printers that you can use to create parts for your DIY projects

* [Roboelectronics](https://ere.mcgilleus.ca/) - A great club to learn hands-on skills in electronics and robotics to McGill students with all levels of experience.


## Project Ideas
Theories are one thing! Practicing is another! As engineers, we learn by doing! If you have something you've been curious about or a passion for a certain topic, make a project out of it! You will learn so much and as a result become a better engineer for it! (Projects look fantastic for side projects too ;))

* [Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/technology/) - This is a great DIY website that provides tutorials on how to make some neat electronic gadgets!

* [Adafruit](https://learn.adafruit.com/) - This website sells a bunch of great electronics but also gives great tutorials on what you can do with those electronics
